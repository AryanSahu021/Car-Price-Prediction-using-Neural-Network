# Car Price Prediction using Fully Connected Neural Network with TensorFlow

This project aims to predict car prices using a fully connected neural network implemented with TensorFlow. The dataset used for training and testing is sourced from Kaggle, comprising various features related to cars such as mileage, horsepower, and number of km travelled.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: [link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayankpatel14/second-hand-used-cars-data-set-linear-regression). It contains a comprehensive set of features and corresponding car prices, which serve as the target variable for our predictive model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and modifying the code interactively)

## Model Architecture
The neural network model architecture consists of multiple fully connected layers with appropriate activation functions. The input features are normalized before being fed into the model to ensure better convergence and performance.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This metric provide insights into the accuracy and generalization ability of the model.
